Why we don't use local computers/laptops to host websites

1) limited in system resources(RAM, Disk processor, internet bandwidth)
2) we have to keep it up all the time it needs to be connected to power supply that's
why we want to put everything on servers
Software deployment life cycle.
1) Idea
2) mock design
3) SRD(Software Requirement Document)
4) software architects take SRD and develop SRS(all the details related to tools programming languages
hardware requirements number of classes method names all is mentioned in this)
5) Developers take SRS and start the code
6) Tester they take SRD and start designing the test cases.
Actual Software deployment life cycle starts from here developers will develop the codes on local computers and
will push it to the dev servers once basic things work on dev server it is deployed to QA serverx
staging
production
usually 3-5 persons are involved even in a very basic web app(Hello World).
